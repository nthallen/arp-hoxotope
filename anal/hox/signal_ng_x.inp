; signal_ng_x.inp
; inp. file to calculate signals (cnts/.25sec /Xlas(V)) from detection axes.
; modified 1/12/93 to account for undercounting 
;                and to NaN sig when xlas<.01
; modified 1/13/93 to devide by UVMon instead of Xlas
; modified 5/8/93 to change gate widths to those observed in 930507
; modified to any Hz 4/16/97
;
; USE NON-GATED CHANNELS.
;
;  Modified 11/10/97 to analyze 970416.4  On this day the
;  Adj gate is complemented to the Non-gated channel.  Some
;  of the signal is outside of the adj gate.  True non-gated
;  signal is c1 + c3.  For future flights fg and ng are complemented.
;  True non-gated for these flights is c2 + c3.
